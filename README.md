# Full-MERN-Stack-Project

In this project, I have meticulously developed a professional-grade application utilizing the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. This application includes comprehensive authentication features such as sign-in and sign-up functionalities. Additionally, it offers advanced capabilities including search, pagination, filtering, as well as import and export functionalities.
